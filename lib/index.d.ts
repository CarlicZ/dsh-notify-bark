 * Mounts three pieces:
 *   1. the plugin's Loader `Config` schema (volatile fields → live references
 *      persisted through DSH's settings document and hot-applied in place);
 *   2. the session/event listener that turns turn endings, user questions,
 *      plan reviews, and approval requests into Bark pushes (Host-side, so the
 *      browser being closed does not matter). Each push is summarized by the
 *      current default model and may take its icon/group from the workspace
 *      `.env`;
 *   3. the barkNotify Typert Remote the settings section reads and writes
 *      through the shared /api channel (the Bark URL never rides a read).
 *
 * The browser half (the `./client` entry) registers the settings section.
